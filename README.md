# NavProt web application 

NavProt is a web application for calculating trajectories for conformational transition pathways of proteins. It uses a unique robot navigation algorithm to find the minimum energy pathway to the target conformation.

This repository contains the source code for NavProt web application. The application is developed using [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/). You can see the working version of the application [in this link](http://safir.prc.boun.edu.tr/navprot/). You can also download the desktop version of the application from [here](http://safir.prc.boun.edu.tr/navprot/downloads).
